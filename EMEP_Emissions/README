            Summer timeshift (/disk4/ATMOVISION/EMEP2WRF/TEMPORAL_ALLOCATION/COUNTRIES-LIST-summer.data)
   Method:  Generate a dataframe of hourly factors during the year for each grid cell
            Apply the hourly factor to the annual emission
   Output:  Gridded temporal emission CSV
   
3. EMEP_emis2d_Speciation.py
   Goal:    Convert surface emission CSV to CAMx-ready 2D NetCDF for surface emission sectors
   Inputs:  Outputs from step 2 -- Gridded temporal emission CSV for surface emission sectors
            Speciation factors by pollutant and GNFR sector (/disk4/ATMOVISION/EMEP2WRF/TEMPORAL_ALLOCATION/NFR2CAMx_speciation.csv)
   Method:  Apply the speciation factor to get the hourly emission for each species.
            For every 24 hour timestamps, reshape the data to a tdim*xdim*ydim array.
            Create emission NetCDF with lat, lon, and emission data.
   Output:  CAMx ready NetCDF for surface emission sectors

4. EMEP_emis3d_Speciation.py
   Goal:    Convert surface emission CSV to CAMx-ready 3D NetCDF for emissions sectors that have a height component
   Inputs:  Outputs from step 2 -- Gridded temporal emission CSV for emissions sectors that have a height component
            Speciation factors by pollutant and GNFR sector (/disk4/ATMOVISION/EMEP2WRF/TEMPORAL_ALLOCATION/NFR2CAMx_speciation.csv)
            Layering factors for each point emission sectors (/disk4/ATMOVISION/EMEP2WRF/TEMPORAL_ALLOCATION/Height_NFR.csv)
   Method:  Apply the speciation factor to get the hourly emission for each species.
            At each timestamps, reshape the data to a xdim*ydim array.
            Apply layering factors to make the data zdim*xdim*ydim.
            Stack emission arrays of the same day together to make a tdim*zdim*xdim*ydim array.
            Create emission NetCDF with lat, lon, and emission data.
   Output:  CAMx-ready 3D NetCDF for point emission sectors
